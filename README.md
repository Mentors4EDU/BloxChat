# BloxChat
Bloxchat is a new type of social network
### Currently social networks struggle with the following:
 - Bots
 - Abuse
 - Monopolization
 
We aim to fix all this with a nice decentralized alternative that will:
 - Have only a follow botton that way people's following doesn't drop
 - To avoid abuse we have the following:
    - Two card metrics on your profile: 
      - One that shows the average engagement per post you write
      - And the other shows a percentage for the average engagement per post your followers write
This way, people are able to determine who is "the real deal"

#### Likely to be deployed via SteemConnect
